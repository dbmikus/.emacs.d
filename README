------------------------------

This is my emacs configuration folder. I don't use a .emacs file,
but instead use the init.el file in this folder.

Following is a brief description of the parts of this directory:

init.el:
    Does minor top-level setup and then loads a number of other files
    to outsource the customization

elisp:
    Contains my written emacs configuration files. These are NOT files
    and directories that other people have made.

others-elisp:
    Contains all code written by other people. As of now, not all external
    code has been moved here. I need to move everything here and change
    filepath references

notes:
    Contains notes and not emacs code. This is stuff mostly for my development
    notes and general design

elpa:
    "Emacs Lisp Package Archive" manages emacs packages for easy install and
    upgrades.

requirements.yaml:
    A list of resources and requirements to download from


All other directories should probably be sorted into there proper places. Most
likely, the place for these other directories will be "others-elisp".
